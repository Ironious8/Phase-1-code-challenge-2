# Topic:Code challenges

# Purpose
To complete the code challenges assigned by creating programs that will
accomplish the given functions


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a github repository for rhe assignment.
 2. Create a directory for the assignments.(mkdir folder name)
 3. Create the necessary files for the work(touch file.txt)
 4. Get started on the assignments.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. node modules
2. index.css
3. index.html
4. index.js
5. package-lock.json
6. package.json
7. README.md


# Procedure
First we start by maintaining an array of shopping list items and then we create a HTML structure with
an input field for adding items, a list container to display the items and create buttons for adding items, marking items as purchased and clearing a list.
Then use javascript to put functionality to the buttons and then add event listeners to the respective buttons.
Also add some styling properties to the work using CSS.



# Working through errors
The codes should be run through the live server in the browser in order to confirm whether the codes are working.If they are not working, the live server should display the errors in the codes which should give clues on how to rectify the errors.


# Submitting work done
After finishing the code challenges, the following should be done:
1. Save your changes
2. Link your local repository with your remote repository(git remote add origin).
3. Add your files(git add .)
4. Commit your changes(git commit -m "message")
5. Push your changes to the remote repository(git push origin branch name)

After finishing these steps you should see your updates changes in your github profile.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The code challenges have been successfully completed and submitted!
